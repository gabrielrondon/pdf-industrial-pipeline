## 🎨 Design Specifications

### Quality Indicator Design:
```tsx
// Color-coded quality scoring
const getQualityColor = (score: number) => {
  if (score >= 85) return "text-green-600 bg-green-50"    // Excelente
  if (score >= 70) return "text-blue-600 bg-blue-50"     // Boa
  if (score >= 50) return "text-yellow-600 bg-yellow-50" // Média
  return "text-red-600 bg-red-50"                        // Baixa
}
```

### Compliance Status Design:
```tsx
// CPC Article 889 compliance indicators
const ComplianceIcon = {
  compliant: "✅ Conforme",
  partial: "⚠️ Parcialmente Conforme", 
  noncompliant: "❌ Não Conforme"
}
```

### Recommendations Priority:
```tsx
// Priority-based recommendation styling
const PriorityStyles = {
  critical: "border-red-500 bg-red-50",
  high: "border-orange-500 bg-orange-50",
  medium: "border-yellow-500 bg-yellow-50",
  low: "border-gray-500 bg-gray-50"
}
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### User Experience Improvements:
| Metric | Before | After Week 4 | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Quality Awareness | 0% | 100% | Complete visibility |
| Compliance Understanding | Manual | Automated | Real-time feedback |
| Action Clarity | Vague | Specific | Clear next steps |
| Decision Speed | Slow | Fast | Instant insights |
| User Satisfaction | Baseline | +40% | Better experience |

### Interface Features:
- **Real-time Quality Scoring**: Instant 0-100 feedback
- **Visual Compliance Indicators**: CPC Article 889 status
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Prioritized improvement suggestions
- **Progress Tracking**: Quality improvement over time
- **Intelligence Showcase**: Enhanced features visibility

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### API Integration Flow:
```typescript
// Quality assessment flow
Document Upload → Enhanced Features (Week 1) → 
OCR Processing (Week 2) → Quality Assessment (Week 3) → 
Smart Interface Display (Week 4)
```

### State Management:
```typescript
interface QualityState {
  assessment: QualityMetrics
  compliance: ComplianceResult
  recommendations: RecommendationSet
  loading: boolean
  error: string | null
}
```

### Real-time Updates:
```typescript
// WebSocket or polling for live quality updates
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    fetchQualityUpdates(documentId)
  }, 5000) // Update every 5 seconds
}, [documentId])
```

## 💡 Smart Features
