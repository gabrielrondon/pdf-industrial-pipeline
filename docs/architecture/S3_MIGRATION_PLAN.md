## Migration Process

### Pre-Migration Checklist

**1. AWS Account Setup**:
- [ ] Create AWS account or use existing
- [ ] Set up IAM user with S3 permissions
- [ ] Generate access keys for Railway deployment
- [ ] Choose S3 region (recommend `us-east-1` for cost)

**2. S3 Bucket Configuration**:
- [ ] Create S3 bucket with unique name
- [ ] Configure bucket policies for security
- [ ] Enable versioning (optional, for data protection)
- [ ] Set up lifecycle policies (optional, for cost optimization)

**3. Testing Environment**:
- [ ] Test S3 credentials with AWS CLI
- [ ] Verify Railway can access S3 from their infrastructure
- [ ] Run integration tests with storage backend

### Zero-Downtime Migration Steps

**Step 1: Environment Configuration (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Set S3 configuration in Railway
railway variables --set 'STORAGE_BACKEND=s3'
railway variables --set 'S3_BUCKET=your-pdf-pipeline-bucket'
railway variables --set 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key'
railway variables --set 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key'
railway variables --set 'S3_REGION=us-east-1'
```

**Step 2: Application Restart (30 seconds)**
```bash
# Trigger Railway deployment with new variables
railway up
```

**Step 3: Verification (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-railway-url/health

# Upload test file
curl -X POST "https://your-railway-url/api/v1/jobs/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test.pdf"
```

**Step 4: Data Migration (Optional)**
```bash
# If preserving existing files, use migration script
python scripts/migrate_storage.py --source=local --target=s3
```

### Rollback Plan

**If Migration Issues Occur**:
```bash
# Immediate rollback to local storage
railway variables --set 'STORAGE_BACKEND=local'
railway up

# Verify system operation
curl https://your-railway-url/health
```

**Data Safety**:
- Original files remain in Railway local storage
- S3 migration is additive, not destructive
- Can run dual storage temporarily for validation

## Cost Analysis

### Storage Cost Comparison

**Current (Railway Local)**:
- **5GB storage**: Included in $5/month plan
- **Cost per GB**: $1.00/month (allocated cost)
- **Overage**: Requires Pro plan upgrade ($20/month)

**S3 Standard Storage**:
- **First 50 TB/month**: $0.023/GB/month
- **PUT requests**: $0.0005 per 1,000 requests
- **GET requests**: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests

### Cost Examples

**100GB Storage**:
- **Railway Pro required**: $20/month + potential overages
- **S3 Standard**: $2.30/month + minimal request fees
- **Savings**: ~$18/month (87% cost reduction)

**1TB Storage**:
- **Railway**: Would require Enterprise plan (custom pricing)
- **S3 Standard**: $23/month
- **S3 Intelligent Tiering**: $15-20/month (with automatic optimization)

**Break-even Point**: S3 becomes cost-effective at ~10GB of storage

### Request Cost Estimation

**Monthly Usage** (1,000 files processed):
- **PUT requests**: 1,000 uploads × $0.0005/1000 = $0.0005
- **GET requests**: 5,000 downloads × $0.0004/1000 = $0.002
- **Total request costs**: <$0.01/month

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

**IAM Policy for Railway**:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject", 
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-pdf-pipeline-bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-pdf-pipeline-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Security Best Practices**:
- ✅ Use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- ✅ Enable S3 bucket encryption at rest (AES-256)
- ✅ Block public bucket access (unless needed for specific use cases)
- ✅ Enable CloudTrail for audit logging
- ✅ Use presigned URLs for temporary access

### Data Protection

**Backup Strategy**:
- **S3 Versioning**: Keep multiple versions of files
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Automatic backup to different region
- **S3 Glacier**: Long-term archival for compliance

**Encryption**:
- **Server-side encryption**: AES-256 or KMS
- **In-transit encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all transfers
- **Client-side encryption**: Optional for sensitive documents

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics to Track

**Storage Metrics**:
- Total storage usage and growth rate
- Number of objects stored
- Storage class distribution (if using tiering)
- Monthly storage costs

**Performance Metrics**:
- Upload/download success rates
- Average request latency
- Error rates by operation type
- Bandwidth utilization

**Cost Metrics**:
- Monthly storage costs
- Request costs breakdown
- Data transfer costs
- Cost per processed file

### Recommended CloudWatch Alerts

**Cost Protection**:
- Monthly S3 costs exceed $50
- Storage growth rate >100GB/month
- Unusual request volume (>10,000/hour)

**Performance Alerts**:
- S3 error rate >1% over 5 minutes
- Average latency >1 second for uploads
- Failed requests >10 in 5 minutes

**Security Alerts**:
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Unusual download patterns
- Bucket policy changes

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Migration Issues

**1. Permission Denied Errors**:
```bash
# Check IAM policy
aws iam get-user-policy --user-name railway-s3-user --policy-name S3Access

# Test access
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name
```

**2. Connection Timeout**:
```python
# Check network connectivity from Railway
import aioboto3
session = aioboto3.Session()
async with session.client('s3') as s3:
    await s3.head_bucket(Bucket='your-bucket')
```

**3. Bucket Not Found**:
```bash
# Verify bucket exists and region
aws s3api head-bucket --bucket your-bucket-name --region us-east-1
```

### Performance Optimization

**Upload Performance**:
- Use multipart uploads for files >100MB
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Optimize chunk sizes based on network conditions

**Download Performance**:
- Use CloudFront CDN for frequently accessed files
- Implement range requests for large files
- Cache presigned URLs appropriately
