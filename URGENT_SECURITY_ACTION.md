# 🚨 URGENT SECURITY ACTION REQUIRED 🚨

## IMMEDIATE STEPS (DO THIS NOW):

1. **GO TO AWS CONSOLE IMMEDIATELY**
   - https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users
   - Find your user: `pdf-pipeline-s3-user` (or whatever you named it)
   - Click on the user → Security credentials tab
   - Find the Access Key that starts with `AKIAS56ATHGVURVAGIR6`
   - Click "Deactivate" → then "Delete"

2. **CREATE NEW CREDENTIALS**
   - Same page → Create access key
   - Save the new credentials SECURELY (password manager, not in chat!)

3. **CHECK FOR UNAUTHORIZED USAGE**
   - Go to AWS Billing Dashboard
   - Check for any unexpected charges
   - Enable billing alerts if not already done

## WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:

- Anyone who sees these credentials can:
  - Access your S3 buckets
  - Upload/delete your files
  - Incur charges on your AWS account
  - Potentially access other AWS services

## SECURE CREDENTIAL STORAGE:

### NEVER store credentials in:
- ❌ Chat messages
- ❌ Code files
- ❌ Git repositories
- ❌ Plain text files
- ❌ Email

### ALWAYS store credentials in:
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Railway/Heroku config vars
- ✅ AWS Secrets Manager
- ✅ Password managers (1Password, LastPass)
- ✅ `.env` files (NEVER commit to git!)

## FOR YOUR NEW CREDENTIALS:

1. **Local Development** - Create `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # apps/api/.env (NEVER commit this!)
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-new-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-new-secret
   S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
   S3_REGION=us-east-1
   STORAGE_BACKEND=s3
   ```

2. **Add to .gitignore**:
   ```bash
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   echo "*.env" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. **Railway Production**:
   ```bash
   # Use Railway dashboard or CLI
   railway variables set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=new-key
   railway variables set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=new-secret
   ```

## SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:

1. **Rotate credentials regularly** (every 90 days)
2. **Use IAM roles** instead of keys when possible
3. **Enable MFA** on your AWS account
4. **Set up billing alerts** to catch unauthorized usage
5. **Use least privilege** - only grant necessary permissions
